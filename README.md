### About

MCHoneyPot works by creating a realistic looking Minecraft server, faking details such as players online, server version etc. 
It's job is to log all attempts made to interact with the server including pings, status requests, and attempts to join.
The goal is to index, report, and raise awareness of mass server scanning and how it can affect server owners.
